# Portfolio-by-nathalie-nordstrom
My portfolio

This week I did a portfolio based on a design from Technigo and the hole site is builed in HTML and CSS.
Record in number of code lines! 

To start I went through all the sections and added all the parts to then go back and structure it better 
and also with the CSS. I have mixed both flexbox and grid where I think it fit best.
I tested the color contrast and had to change it for the better and some closing tags here and there. 

I think this was a fun experience to look at a design and try to copy it without the seeing the code for it. 
So now i know that it is possible if i see something I like I am able to code it for my project if i like to.
